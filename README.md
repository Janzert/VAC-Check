# What is VAC Check?
VAC Check is a userscript designed to easily allow people to check VAC ban status on players you've played with recently. If you think someone in your competitive game is hacking, check back in a couple days and see their VAC banned profile!

You can use something like [VacStat.us](http://vacstat.us) but I made this to remove the effort it takes to manually add players into a list. You won't be able to track everyone but you will be able to track recent players.
